# Kart_Rider_GUI

Kart Rider Rush Plus is a mobile game that is available on both ios and android devices. As the game does not have any comparative ranking based on the personal records of multiple tracks, I have made a GUI that calcualtes personal ranking based on track records. As the game does not provide API, I have had a Google Forms filled out multiple people in my club to collect necessary data.


KRGUI.py is English based python file and KRGUI-KR.py is Korean based python file.

Both python files will require the user to download kartriderdataset.csv file.
To run KRGUI-KR.py, Korean based python file, NotoSansKR-Medium.otf file is required as well.
